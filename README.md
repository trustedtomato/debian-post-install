# Debian post-install
My post-install script for Debian. 

# How to use?

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustedtomato/debian-post-install/master/install.sh > install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    
...or you can replace that long URL with https://tinyurl.com/y35sprgh.

Then just follow the instructions (lines starting with `[!!!]`).
